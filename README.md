A multi-layer perceptron built entirely in **NumPy** — no PyTorch, no TensorFlow, no autograd. Every forward pass, backward pass, and weight update is written by hand.

Trained on MNIST (60k images). Achieves **97.91% test accuracy**.

## Architecture

```
Input (784)
    ↓
Dense (784 → 128) + ReLU
    ↓
Dense (128 → 64) + ReLU
    ↓
Dense (64 → 10) + Softmax
    ↓
Output (10 classes)
```

Weights initialized with **Xavier initialization**: `W = randn * sqrt(1 / input_dim)`

## Built from Scratch

- **Forward pass** — matrix multiplication, bias addition, activation functions
- **Backpropagation** — full chain rule implementation through every layer
- **ReLU** — forward `max(0, z)` and backward `d_out * (input > 0)`
- **Softmax** — numerically stable implementation with combined Softmax + CrossEntropy gradient `(predictions - y_true) / batch_size`
- **CrossEntropy Loss** — `- mean(sum(y_true * log(clip(pred)), axis=1))`
- **Mini-batch SGD** — shuffles data every epoch, processes in batches of 64
- **L2 Regularization** — weight decay term `λ * W` added to gradient during update; biases not regularized
- **Xavier Initialization** — prevents vanishing/exploding gradients at initialization
- **MNIST data pipeline** — downloads, parses IDX binary format, normalizes, one-hot encodes

## Design Decisions

**Softmax owns the CrossEntropy backward pass.** The combined gradient of Softmax + CrossEntropy collapses to `(predictions - y_true) / batch_size`, so `CrossEntropyLoss` has no `backward` method — Softmax absorbs it entirely.

**Biases are excluded from L2 regularization.** Penalizing biases yields no benefit and can actively hurt convergence. Only weights receive the decay term.

**Weight saving is architecture-agnostic.** The training loop identifies Dense layers via `hasattr(layer, 'W')` rather than hardcoded indices, so the architecture can be restructured without breaking save/load logic.
